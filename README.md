- Database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) depending on your setup

#Instructions
Clone the Repository Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:

#git clone https://github.com/Nicz1407/Software-Engineering.git
Navigate to the Project Directory Change into the project directory:

#cd Software-Engineering
Install Dependencies Install the required packages using npm:

#npm install
Set Up the Database

#Create a new database in your preferred database management system.
#Update the database connection settings in the configuration file (e.g., config.js or .env).
#Run Database Migrations (if applicable) If your project uses migrations, run the following command:
